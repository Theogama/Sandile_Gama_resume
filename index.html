<body>


    <p> My name is Sandile Gama I grew up in a Town called Daveton My dreams started when 
        I believed what is in my head can come to life when 
        I realized that the power of our imagination can change what doesn't exist to 
        life I never knew what coding was until I got so fascinated by the changing technology brings to our human nature.<br><br>

        That is where I developed a passion for my newly developed skill of being a software developer. 
        I've developed a love to code and build other software programs in Bootcamp, 
        I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to do great in projects. In the boot camp, 
        I learned skills that helped me to do my best in my tasks. I am an ambitious and driven candidate. 
        I thrive on challenges and constantly set goals for myself, 
        I'm willing to learn I'm a fast learner and I am looking for a job that is Happy to have me.
